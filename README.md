Pulmonary Respiration Analysis & Noise-free Assessment

PRANA is a lightweight, offline, and explainable respiratory health screening system that analyzes breathing sounds captured through a smartphone microphone to determine whether a user’s breathing is normal or abnormal.
It further classifies normal breathing into deep or slow breathing, and provides confidence-based insights, remedies, and recommendations for abnormal breathing patterns.

⚠️ Disclaimer: PRANA is a screening and assistive tool, not a medical diagnosis system.

🚀 Features

- Captures breathing audio using microphone input
- Signal-processing–based analysis (no black-box ML)
-Uses core DSA concepts for real-time processing
- Classifies breathing as:

Normal → Deep / Slow

Abnormal → Confidence %, reasons & remedies

📄 Generates a clear CLI-based respiratory health report

🔌 Fully offline and lightweight

🎓 Designed for academic evaluation, hackathons & demos
